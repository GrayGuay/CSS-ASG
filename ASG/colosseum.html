        <p>
            The construction of the Colosseum began under Emperor Vespasian in 70 AD and was completed in 80 AD under his son, Emperor Titus. It was primarily used for gladiatorial games and public entertainment, reflecting the social and political culture of the Roman Empire.  
            Over the centuries, the Colosseum suffered damage from earthquakes, stone-robbers, and natural wear, but restoration efforts have preserved much of its structure.  
            Today, it stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a major tourist attraction, offering a glimpse into Ancient Roman life.
