     <h2>Cultural and Religious Significance</h2>
<div class="section-text">
  <p>
    Machu Picchu held deep cultural and spiritual importance for the Inca
    civilization. It is believed to have been a royal estate for Emperor
    Pachacuti and a sacred ceremonial center.

    <!-- History -->
    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <div class="section-text">
        <p>
            Machu Picchu was built around 1450 during the height of the Inca Empire, likely as a royal estate or religious site. It was abandoned a century later during the Spanish conquest, though the citadel was never discovered by Spanish conquistadors.  
            The site remained largely unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it international attention in 1911.  
            Today, Machu Picchu is one of the most visited archaeological sites in the world and a symbol of Incan ingenuity.
