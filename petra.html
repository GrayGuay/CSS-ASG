  <h2>Cultural and Religious Significance</h2>

    Petra was the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom and a center of trade, culture, and religion in the ancient Arab world.
    Its elaborate tombs, temples, and carvings reflect the spiritual and cultural practices of the Nabataeans, who revered
    natural rock formations and developed sophisticated rituals around water and nature.

    <!-- History -->
    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <div class="section-text">
        <p>
            Petra was established as early as the 4th century BC by the Nabataeans, who controlled major trade routes connecting Arabia, Egypt, and the Mediterranean. The city flourished due to its advanced water management system, allowing it to survive in a desert environment.
            Petra later came under Roman control in 106 AD and gradually declined after earthquakes and changes in trade routes.
            The city was largely forgotten by the Western world until it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Ludwig_Burckhardt" target="_blank">Johann Ludwig Burckhardt</a>.
